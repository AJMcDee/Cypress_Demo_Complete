# Base React Application for Cypress Demo

This is a sample app from "Watch Tests Go Brrrr: Getting Started with Cypress in ReactJS". View `./cypress/integration` to see the exercises in pseudocode, with the results (and other options) available in `./cypress/support`.

Make sure the cypress backend is running (in `./cypress.backend`).

Execute `npm start` in the main directory. 

To run cypress, use `cypress open` or `npm run e2e-test`.
